## 1st International Workshop on Smart Contract Analysis

Smart contracts are versatile instruments that can not only facilitate and verify transactions in financial services, but also track the movement of physical goods and intellectual property. Security and correctness are essential for smart contract technology, because contracts possess the authority to allocate high-value resources between complex systems and are, for the most part, autonomous. Smart contracts have been the targets of widely publicized attacks, some successful in inflicting considerable financial damage.  The workshop will include an invited talk from a prominent smart contract practitioner or security researcher.

This workshop is broadly focused, and considers all approaches to analyzing smart contracts, static and dynamic. It covers, but is not limited to:
* Analysis-based vulnerability discovery (e.g. heuristics-based static analysis, fuzzing) 
* Sound analysis (e.g. model checking, temporal logic)
* Code optimization (e.g. code-size reduction, gas-cost estimation)
* Code understanding (e.g. decompilation, reverse engineering)
* Code monitoring (e.g. debugging, fault detection)
* Intermediate representation (e.g. design, specification)

The workshop aims to bring researchers and practitioners together and will promote open and reproducible research. Papers improving existing tools or proposing new ones are encouraged.
